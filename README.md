- AI: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
- Search: Google Search API integration

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A Google API key with access to Gemini API
- (Optional) A Search1API key for alternative search backend

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Gemini-Search.git
   cd Gemini-Search
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and run with docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Or run with custom port:
   ```bash
   PORT=3125 docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key with access to Gemini API
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "development" by default, use "production" for production builds
- `PORT`: (Optional) Custom port for the server, defaults to 3000
- `BASE_URL`: (Optional) Custom Gemini API endpoint
- `SEARCH1_API_KEY`: (Optional) Required if using search1api tool instead of Google Search

## Search Tools

The project supports two search backends:
1. **Google Search** (default): Uses Google's built-in search capability
2. **Search1API**: An alternative search backend ([search1api.com](https://search1api.com)) that:
   - Costs 5x less than Google Search
   - Response time is 2x slower than Google Search
   - Requires:
     - Set `BASE_URL=https://ground.search1api.com`
     - Set `SEARCH1_API_KEY=your_search1api_key`

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run start`: Run the production server
- `npm run check`: Run TypeScript type checking

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API keys
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files
- If you fork this repository, make sure to use your own API keys
